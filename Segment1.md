# PollutionSight
## Goal 
We will examine air pollution data to identify and visualize patterns and create a machine learning model to predict future pollutant levels in specific cities. Using pollution data in the United States from 2000-2016, we will also compare the predicitions of the machine learning model to actual data from 2017-2022 to determine if the coronavirus pandemic has a measurable effect on the pollutants in the chosen cities.

Pollution is an invisible enemy that affects many aspects of our lives even if we cannot always see those effects. Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has changed the lives of people all over the world for the last 2.5 years. Seeing what effect that the pandemic has had on the pollution of major cities and its effects on the predictions of our pollution model is an interesting and important factor to measure to better prepare ourselves for the pollution questions of the future. 

## Data
To examine the effects of pollution, we have chosen a pollution dataset from Kaggle that has information about 4 major pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide(NO2), Sulphur Dioxide(SO2), Carbon Monoxide(CO) and Ozone(O3). We will store our data in a bucket on Amazon AWS and load it into a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin.

## Inquiries
With our pollution data, we will attempt to answer some important questions:

* What are the pollution levels several major cities?
* Can we use the older pollution data to predict future levels?
* What effect, if any, did the coronavirus pandemis have on the pollution levels of those cities?

## Communication
To communicate and coloborte effectively, our group has created our own messaging channel on slack and is using Google calendar to coordinate meeting times so that we can conduct several zoom meetings  per week to complete our project deliverables together.
