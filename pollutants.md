# Pollutant Definitions

### Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
Nitrogen Dioxide comes from emissions from automobiles such as cars, trucks and buses as well as from power plants. Exposure to NO2 can lead to asthma and respiratory infections.

### Ozone (O3)
While ozone in the upper atmosphere is good, it is harmful at the surface level. It is created by the chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Prolonged exposure decreases lung function and exacerbates conditions such as emphysema and asthma.

### Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Carabon monoxide is emitted by any type of vehicle that uses fossil fuels. It affects the amount of oxygen in the blood stream delivered to vital organs and can cause unconsciousness and death in high concentrations.

### Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
Fossil fuels and volcanic activity are the primary sources of sulfur dioxide emissions. High amounts of sulfur dioxide can lead to respiratory system inflammation and decreased lung function as well as the worsening of asthma and heart disease.
